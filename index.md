Welcome to my site. I am passionate about leveraging technology and building user-centric products to solve important, real-world problems that impact our democracy: securing our government, institutions, people, and information. I love to read about and discuss the intersection of technology, security, privacy, policy, and geopolitics. 

Simple websites are the perfect intersection of minimal design & maximum security. 

I provide Political Tech / Campaign Security consulting:
- Setting up all of the apps & tools for document sharing, chat, comms, etc. 
- Properly & securing configuring websites, email, and apps
- User onboarding & trainings
- Protecting websites from common & sophisticated attacks (from SQL injection to DDoS)
- Implementation of more complex tools like two-factor authentication, password managers, and security keys

I also provide Product Management consulting:
- Identifying & assessing product-market fit
- Product strategy
- Feature discovery and product specs
- Creating & evaluating design prototypes
- End-to-end project/product management across multiple teams
